            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                This is my current latest WordPress site. Itâ€™s purpose is to provide a listings service for a company that designs and constructs properties.
                <br><br>
                The user is able to add listings, providing a description, image gallery, prices and details. The front page is dynamically populated with the listings added in the back end. 
                <br><br>
                The banner slider is manually chosen, however the items below are taken from the database and link to an item. There is a listings page with a search and filter feature which works asynchronously. 
                <br><br>
                The example above is limited to just the front page, as the customer is populating the back end.
            </p>
