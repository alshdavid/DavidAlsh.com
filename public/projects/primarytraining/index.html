            <p>
                Primary training was the first website I had ever made. How I went about it perfectly demonstrated my character. 
                <br><br>
                With no experience other than an understanding of what’s involved, I contacted a company and hustled myself a little freelance contract.
                <br><br>
                It took me 2 weeks to complete, working over 12 hours a day, the entire time in way over my head. I had hardly seen CSS before but the pressure of the payment kept me focused on the task. 
                <br><br>
                When I completed this and handed it over, I felt incredible, I was hooked. I didn’t want to lose that momentum so I looked for other people interested in websites. This only so I could find a reason to push myself a learn more. 
                <br><br>
                Through this “can I do it?” became “it’s a matter of time”. Since then I have not stopped exceeding my own expectations of myself. It serves as a reminder of how hard I have worked to get where I am today and always fills me with pride to look over.
