            <br><br>
            <p>
                The Freight Broker’s website was a good show of my skills with CSS animation and my attention to detail.
                <br><br>
                The client (and designer) had some vague ideas of what they wanted the animation to do. I was given the visual assets and given the run down.
                <br><br>
                The challenge here begins with making the truck look like it’s moving towards you, rather than simply zooming in and the challenge ends at making the whole scene responsive.
                <br><br>
                The background image is a great example of its issue being responsive. Every screen size has a different animation, and the animation remains performant, even on low end devices.
