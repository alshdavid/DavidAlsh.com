    <h3>Brown Paper Bag</h3>
    <p>An incredible web development company, an incredible team.</p>
    <br><br>
    <img class="mobile" src="./projects/brownpaperbag/img/1.jpg" alt="HTML Templater">
    <p>I was hired by BrownPaperBag in 2016 as a front end developer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During my time there, I worked in teams which put together websites and web applications for clients.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We formed a cohesive unit, where each member contributed their strengths where, between the throwing paper at each other and banter, we crafted high quality products.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In my time there, I produced a mojority of my professional work in my portfolio. <br><br>Due to how collaborative the team was, I was even given creative freedom to tackle projects in my own way which allowed me to introduce the team to Angular 2</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>While there I used the following technologies:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML/SCSS/JS/TS</li>
        <li>PHP Laravel</li>
        <li>WordPress</li>
        <li>Angular 2</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
