            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                I began my employment with BrownPaperBag in late July 2016 as a junior front end developer. I was responsible for constructing website front-ends from designs provided to me by the design team, building them into their custom content management system.
                <br><br>
                Essentially, I was translating the designer's vision into a product that the back-end team could make dynamic.
                <br><br>
                The back-end was using PHP + the Laravel framework.
                <br><br>
                I applied myself diligently and my skills developed rapidly. Initially I was responsible for just HTML/CSS, however that quickly evolved to incorporating complex JavaScript and eventually leading a team in the development of a progressive web app (PWA) built in Angular2.
                <br><br>
                Between the Friday barbeques and the late nights, BrownPaperBag threw me into an intense rollercoaster of learning and laughs. The developers I worked with were incredible people, both professionally and as friends. Having gone through the trenches with them, I feel a great deal of respect for their capacity and an even greater pride for the incredible team work.
                <br><br>
                I look forward to many more beers, barbeques and late nights with the squad.
