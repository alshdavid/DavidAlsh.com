            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                This was my first commercial WordPress site. I contacted the group OzKiwi after hearing about their successes in the political sphere. They are working on a cause that I believe in and I offered to help out by making them a website. 
                <br><br>
                After meeting with them and having a bit of a laugh, they decided to give me a go.
                <br><br>
                I am looking at upgrading their site when I have some time. There is actually a repo in my GitHub where I am working on a custom site manager made using Node.js, MongoDB, Happi.js and Angular2.
