            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                This is the project that I am currently the most proud of. 
                <br><br>
                After some time, BrownPaperBag felt that I demonstrated a level of aptitude which made it appropriate to give me creative freedom over a project.
                <br><br>    
                To summerise, the purpose of the application was to provide a platform where by the drivers of the Textile Recycling Centre would be able to manage their field duties digitally - including chat and vehicle stop managment.
                <br><br>
                First I received the design briefing, after which I liaised with the team members and began consultation on the technical architecture of the project. The project was entirely API based, using both RESTful and Websocket technologies. 
                <br><br>
                I began by creating the application’s documentation wiki on BrownPaperBag’s private project wiki. Mapped out the API’s endpoints and created the interface for the websocket chat.
                At the time, I had a basic understanding of Angular 2. I had spent more time with Angular 1 in the past so it was easier for me to wrap my head around the concepts in Angular 2. I pushed forward using it as the front-end framework for the application. 
                <br><br>
                As the project grew in size I kept detailed documentation on everything from the folder structure to the application’s build process.
                <br><br>
                The application was built natively using PhoneGap build, leveraging “OneSignal’s” push notification API for the native application and service worker.
                <br><br>
                At the end of the project, the client was blown away with it’s performance and the team congratulated me on it’s success.
            </p>
