                This was one of those "did this really happen?" kind of things. 
                <br /><br />  
                By this point, I had made two websites and thought that creating a start up was within my skill level. I mean, how hard could it be, right?
                <br><br>
                So a few friends and I sat down and started throwing around ideas. The idea of an "Uber for the adult industry" was floated, we all had a good laugh about it, but quickly changed the subject. 
                <br><br>
                The next morning, curiosity  drove me to contact third parties that would be interested in investing their time or brand in the project. 
                <br><br>
                Within the day I found a business partner and the mixture of shock and traction set us off. 
                <br /><br />
                What started as a joke ended up in months of learning AngularJS, mixed with 18 hour 7 day weeks, coffee, coffee, sleeping on the floor, coffee and I still can't believe it happened.
