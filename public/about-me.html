                    <h2>A bit about me</h2> 
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        My name is David, I am a technology enthusiast and have been playing with tech for as long as I can remember. 
                        <br /><br />
                        A little while ago, a friend of mine started studying programming at university, which was the catalyst for my realisation that my skills and understanding of technology was valuable, so I sought to refine them. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Since then I have immersed myself in the world of programming, start ups, and coffee. Led teams, coordinated with team, broke things, googled things, traveled, met people and wouldn't trade my experience for the world/ 
                        <br /><br />
                        I love efficiency and simplicity. Single Page Web Applications are a something of an obsession of mine. 
                        <br /><br />
                        I find learning new systems and putting them into practice extremely rewarding. I'm the kind of person who would suggest amendments or alternative ways of approaching a problem. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Interests outside of programming involve travel, spending time with friends or family, working on motorbikes, fire-spinning, beer.  
                        <br /><br />

                            <p>
                                I'm a little obsessed with single page web applications, I have built a couple of frameworks that you can use to construct SPAs simply, which include a route handling service along with resource lazyloading. 
                                <br /><br />
                                For those projects I used Vanilla JavaScript for that extra performance boost. .
                                <br /><br />
                                Otherwise I have an example Angular2 app in my repository, as well as some simple web development tools like a prepackaged task runner template to get you started with TypeScript and SCSS (with mixins).

                                This was one of those "did this really happen?" kind of things. 
                                <br /><br />  
                                By this point in my career, I had started getting good at making web apps and I wanted to put my chisel to work on a real app project. So a few friends and I started throwing around ideas, and the idea of an "Uber for the adult industry" was floated.
                                <br /><br />
                                We all had a good laugh about it, but quickly changed the subject. The next morning I began looking for third parties that would be interested. Within the day I found a business partner and the race was off.

                                What started as a joke ended up in months of learning AngularJS, mixed with 18 hour 7 day weeks, coffee, coffee, sleeping on the floor, coffee and I still can't believe it happened.

                                As a New Zealander who was living in Australia at the time, it was crazy when I learned about the insane circumstances the immigration laws of Australia put New Zealanders. 
                                <br /><br />  
                                My initial instinct was to do something about it, I didn't have the disposable income to donate to anyone, so I found the most popular organisation and offered to help them with their IT woes.  
                                <br /><br />
                                I put together a communication platform, document sharing service and built them a website in WordPress.
