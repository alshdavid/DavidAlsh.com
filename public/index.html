                            I'm a technology enthusiast, beer drinker and backwards hat wearer
                            </h4>
                            <br><br> Software Development. What a journey.
                            <br><br> For me, it all started when I was 12. My father had bought me my first (and last) console,
                            a PSP. Unfortunately, I had no games with it, and the sound of the menu items clicking only remained
                            entertaining for so long.
                            <br><br> The console reminded me of a Game Boy Advanced, so I assumed it would "just" have Poke'mon.
                            When I discovered it didn't, I realised that I had to find out how to get it working. <strong>BAM.</strong>                            Enter the world of source code, compilers and homebrew games.
                            <br><br> That eventually led on to many late nights, sitting around at night with a pad and a
                            pen, working out game mechanics for fictitious games. I had no idea how to make them, but that
                            didn't stop me from trying to work it out. I thought about what would work, broke down genres
                            and fantasized about the games I would make for myself.
                            <br><br> Eventually, I started making projects like IDEs for PSP homebrew development in C# (essentially
                            a transpiler for LUA that ran off a homebrew LUA interpreter).
                            <br><br> I wanted to be a hacker one day, so I picked up a copy of Red Hat Linux from Dick Smith.
                            I'd installed Windows 98 before, how hard could Linu- oh shi.. what is ext2?
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Skip to today</strong> and I have become a man of shenanigans.
                            <br><br> Leading start-ups. Traveling. Coffee. Engineering. Random Hobbies. Coffee. It kills
                            me to not be doing something ridiculous.
                            <br><br> I am currently employed with Brown Paper Bag in Auckland - an incredible company with
                            some of the most talented people I have met. I am humbled to have been made a part of their team,
                            and have enjoyed every minute of it
                            <br><br> Since working here, I have been strapped into a rollercoaster of intensity. Learning
                            new technologies, given creative freedom and even led a team building a Progressive Web App.
                            <br><br> In the future I look forward to more travel, more shenanigans and more beer (and coffee).
                            <br><br><br>
                            <h4>Okay hot shot, so what can you do?</h4>
                            <br><br> I am passionate about web technologies. I my current favourite stack is Angular2 + Node/Express/Happi
                            + MongoDB.
                            <br><br> I have some skills in UX/UI design and can make HTML do whatever I want it to.
                            <br><br> In the past I have worked with Java, C#, Python. I had a background in object orientation
                            before I moved into the crazy world of JavaScript, with it's observables, promises and asynchronous
                            code.
                            <br><br> Initially, my introduction to JavaScript involved anger. <i>Why can I not just get a return value?.. ok non blocking fine ok.</i>                            Eventually the pain turned into a fondness for it's expressive nature.
                            <br><br> I am currently enjoying implementing more functional programming systems into my applications.
                            <br><br> I really love the flexibility in JavaScript, plus saying big words like "higher order
                            function" scaring other developers makes me feel good about myself.
                            <br><br><br> I really appreciate you getting this far into my bio - <a href="#contact" tabindex="0">click here to contact me</a>
                            <br><br> Peace Out
