                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <h4>
                        I'm a technology enthusiast, beer drinker and backwards hat wearer
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Software Development. What a journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For me, it all started when I was 12. My father had bought me my first (and last) console, a
                        PSP. Unfortunately, I had no games with it, and the sound of the menu items clicking only remained entertaining
                        for so long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The console reminded me of a Game Boy Advanced, so I assumed it would "just" have Poke'mon.
                        When I discovered it didn't, I realised that I had to find out how to get it working. <strong>BAM.</strong>                    Enter the world of source code, compilers and homebrew games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That eventually led on to many late nights, sitting around at night with a pad and a pen, working
                        out game mechanics for fictitious games. I had no idea how to make them, but that didn't stop me from
                        trying to work it out. I thought about what would work, broke down genres and fantasized about the games
                        I would make for myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, I started making projects like IDEs for PSP homebrew development in C# (essentially
                        a transpiler for LUA that ran off a homebrew LUA interpreter).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to be a hacker one day, so I picked up a copy of Red Hat Linux from Dick Smith. I'd
                        installed Windows 98 before, how hard could Linu- oh shi.. what is ext2?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Skip to today</strong> and I have become a man of shenanigans.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Leading start-ups. Traveling. Coffee. Engineering. Random Hobbies. Coffee. It kills me to not
                        be doing something ridiculous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was previously employed by Brown Paper Bag in Auckland - an incredible company with some of
                        the most talented people I have met. I am humbled to have been a part of their team, and have enjoyed
                        every minute of it
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire experience was like being strapped into a rollercoaster. Learning new technologies,
                        given creative freedom and even led a team building a Progressive Web App.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the future I look forward to more travel, more shenanigans, more coffee, and more beer.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Okay hot shot, so what can you do?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about web technologies. My current favourite stack is Angular paired with Node/Express along with the appropriate database technology. I have experience in using both relational and non relational DBs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I handle all of the DevOps, load balancing, security, sysAdmin, etc of my projects and enjoy a bit of terminal Kung Fu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have some skills in UX/UI design and can make HTML do whatever I want it to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the past I have worked with Java, C#, Python. I had a background in object orientation before
                        I moved into the crazy world of JavaScript, with it's prototypes, observables, promises and asynchronous chaos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially, my introduction to JavaScript involved anger. <i>Why can I not just get a return value?.. ok non blocking fine ok.</i>                    Eventually the pain turned into a fondness for it's expressive nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently enjoying implementing more functional programming systems into my applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really love the flexibility in JavaScript, plus saying big words like "higher order function"
                        and scaring other developers makes me feel good about myself.
