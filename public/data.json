The project was entirely API based, using both RESTful and Websocket technologies. <br><br> I began by creating the application’s documentation wiki on BrownPaperBag’s private project wiki. Mapped out the API’s endpoints and created the interface for the websocket chat. At the time, I had a basic understanding of Angular 2. I had spent more time with Angular 1 in the past so it was easier for me to wrap my head around the concepts in Angular 2. I pushed forward using it as the front-end framework for the application. <br><br> As the project grew in size I kept detailed documentation on everything from the folder structure to the application’s build process. <br><br> The application was built natively using PhoneGap build, leveraging “OneSignal’s” push notification API for the native application and service worker. <br><br> At the end of the project, the client was blown away with it’s performance and the team congratulated me on it’s success. </p> <br><br> <h3>Features</h3> <br> <ul> <li>Chat (Text and Photos)</li> <li>Photos</li> <li>GPS</li> <li>Authorisation</li> <li>Custom Design</li> </ul> <br><br> <h3>Technologies</h3> <br> <ul> <li>Angular 2</li> <li>PhoneGap Build</li> <li>Cordova</li> <li>Socket.io</li> <li>Node.js</li> <li>PHP Larvel</li> </ul> ",

I was responsible for constructing website front-ends from designs provided to me by the design team, building them into their custom content management system. <br><br> Essentially, I was translating the designer's vision into a product that the back-end team could make dynamic. <br><br> The back-end was using PHP + the Laravel framework. <br><br> I applied myself diligently and my skills developed rapidly. Initially I was responsible for just HTML/CSS, however that quickly evolved to incorporating complex JavaScript and eventually leading a team in the development of a progressive web app (PWA) built in Angular2. <br><br> Between the Friday barbeques and the late nights, BrownPaperBag threw me into an intense rollercoaster of learning and laughs. The developers I worked with were incredible people, both professionally and as friends. Having gone through the trenches with them, I feel a great deal of respect for their capacity and an even greater pride for the incredible team work. <br><br> I look forward to many more beers, barbeques and late nights with the squad. </p> <br><br> <h3>Responsibilities:</h3> <br> <ul> <li>HTML/SCSS</li> <li>PHP/Laravel</li> <li>WordPress</li> <li>Angular</li> <li>Banter</li> </ul>",
